# image-comics-rss

> rss feed for imagecomics.com/news

As Image Comics does not provide their own rss feed for their news I've built a
scraper that creates a feed from [imagecomics.com/news](https://imagecomics.com/news).

The main feed is publicly accessible at:

```
https://rss.jneidel.com/image/master
```

Category specific feeds [can be found here](https://rss.jneidel.com/image).

## Deploy it yourself

- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- (Automatically rebuild with cron)
